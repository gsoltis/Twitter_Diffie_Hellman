A simple proof-of-concept for using Diffie-Hellman key exchange to establish a secure channel over twitter.

A full implementation would include better security parameters, the ability to converse back and forth, 
and tolerance for looking backwards in the timeline.

The current implementation sends the string 'secret twitter message' from alice to bob and relies on the streaming API for messages going forward.

Also, the project depends on the Tweepy library for twitter integration.
